# Mailing

Tuuwi is using tuuwi.de as a mailing server for all accounts. If you want to join certain mailing lists, please write a mail to hallo@tuuwi.de .
Generally, mailing lists are used to distribute information to a special group of people who subscribed (mostly external people). Currently, nobody owns all passwords for all mailing accounts. The password for info@tuuwi.de is shared individually. All other communication is currently on Telegram. Read more in [Communication](./Communication.md) .
