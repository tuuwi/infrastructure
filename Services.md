# Services

Tuuwi is strictly only trying to use free and open source software and to stay as privacy friendly as possible. We also try to keep the data under our control and try to save as little data as possible. Whenever possible, please use a pseudonym as we do not use any end to end encrypted services.

## Mailing

There are mailing addresses available with the domain tuuwi.de which can be used for groups within the organization. Mails are not under our control and also are not saved encrypted. We did not deploy the mailing server. Mails are not encrypted end to end, so please do not share sensitive information over mail.
